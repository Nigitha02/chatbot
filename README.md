This project is a Streamlit-based AI Chat Assistant powered by the Groq API using the LLaMA 3.1 8B Instant model. It provides an interactive chat interface where users can ask questions and receive real-time, streaming responses with a smooth animation effect. The application maintains conversation history using Streamlit’s session state, allowing context-aware interactions.

The project demonstrates practical integration of large language models into a web application using Python. It includes secure API key management through environment variables (.env file) and uses the python-dotenv package to load sensitive credentials safely. The streaming functionality enhances user experience by displaying responses progressively instead of waiting for the full output.

Overall, this project highlights skills in API integration, secure configuration management, real-time data handling, and building interactive AI-powered applications using Streamlit. It serves as a strong foundation for developing more advanced AI-based web applications and deploying intelligent assistants in real-world scenarios.
